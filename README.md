# Project #2: React To-Do List

## Overview:

You will be making a To-Do List...or a list of any type of items.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

## What You've Learned

By the time you submit this project, you will have covered new ground in, and reviewed, many of the big themes of the course so far:

- **Command Line**: Practice interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.
- **Source Control**: Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.
- **Programming Fundamentals**: Work with objects, constructors, events, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.
- **Web Fundamentals**: Learn how communication happens over the internet, and how to structure, style, and animate documents within a browser. Also learn how to respond to actions your users take and the data they input into the browser.
- **Browser Applications**: Dive into CSS, and figure out how to use libraries and frameworks to get lots of style and functionality for free.
- **Deployment**: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment.
- **Responsive Web Design**: Making web applications that respond to device size.
- **AJAX**: Using Axios to make asynchronous javascript calls.
- **React**: A front end framework for building modern web applications.

## Requirements

- **Build a web application from scratch**, without a starter codebase.  Must be your own work.
- **Use React framework** to build your application
- **Craft a `README.md` file that explains your app** to the world

## Technical Requirements

- **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
  - We will be walking you through this process!
- **User must be able to**
    - Add a new item to the list
    - Mark the item as complete

### Stretch Goals
- Remove an item from the list
- Make To Do List responsive
- Clear all items
- Clear only completed items
- Save data to localstorage or API
- Use 3rd party API with Axios
- Use a 3rd party library

## Necessary Deliverables
- Projects are due Thursday, 21/2 at 9am!  Submissions will be submitted via a google sheet before presentations start.
- A **5 minute presentation** in which you answer the following questions:
  - What is the game about?
  - Is there any information you think might help us understand what you built?
  - What features did you include?
    - Make sure to explain anything "new" (things that we didn't cover in class)
  - What was the most difficult part of the project?
  - What was your favourite part to work on?
  - What would you like to add next?
- A **2 minute demo of your application**:
  - Show us the functionality!
